  In order to test process of the Sale Order, I create sale order
-
  !record {model: sale.order, id: sale_order_test1}:
    partner_id: base.res_partner_2
    note: Invoice after delivery
    payment_term: account.account_payment_term
    order_line:
      - product_id: product.product_product_7
        product_uom_qty: 8
        th_weight: 5.0
    date_expected: 2014-12-25
-
  I confirm the sale order
-
  !workflow {model: sale.order, ref: sale_order_test1, action: order_confirm}
-
  I verify that there was a DO created, and it had the right scheduled date
-
  !assert {model: sale.order, id: sale_order_test1, string: The DO was not created with the right scheduled time}:
    - picking_ids[0].min_date[:10] == '2014-12-25'
